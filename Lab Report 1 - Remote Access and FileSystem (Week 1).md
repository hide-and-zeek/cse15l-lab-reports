The working directory was /home

There was no output

2. path to a directory:

![Image](cd2.png)

The working directory was /home/lecture1

There was no output, but it can be seen that the working directory changed

3. path to a file:
   
![Image](cd3.png)
The working directory was /home/lecture1

The output gave an error message. This error appeared because the current directory did not have the file, it was in another directory.

1. no argument:

![Image](ls1.png)

The working directory was /home

The output listed the names of the files in the current directory

2. path to a directory:
   
![Image](ls2.png)

The working directory was /home

The output listed the names of the files in the specified directory

3. path to a file:
   
![Image](ls3.png)

The working directory was /home

The output was an error message. The error occurred because there are no files to list when directed to that specific file. 

**Command: cat**
1. no argument:
   
![Image](cat1.png)

The working directory was /home

There was no specified working directory hence it made the terminal a keyboard, and prints anything that the user typed out. 

2. path to a directory:
   
![Image](cat2.png)

The working directory was /home

The output printed information about the specific directory. Because the directory had multiple files it didn't print any content of the directory. 

3. path to a file:
   
![Image](cat3.png)

The working directory was /home

This gave an error output. The error occurred because this working directory does not have access to the file its trying to concatenate.
